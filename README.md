# Ceaser Cypher
 The program will apply the Ceaser Cypher to the text that you insert. It will also decypher the encoded text that you write.
 
 This project has been completed. 

## Completed Goals
1) Issue where repeated series of characters are considered conflict with index number. 
2) Fixing the duplicate issue where if different letters are repeated in the inputted word, then the wrong letter is changed rather.
3) Fixing (chracters // 3 = 0) and chracters = 2 with character change in second to last letter resulting in 2 back to back conversions. 
4) Decryption Functionality
