# Ceaser Cypher
 The program will apply the Ceaser Cypher to the text that you insert. It will also decypher the encoded text that you write. 
 
 The encryption method is that every third letter in each word is changed to the letter which is 3 digits to the left of it on the alphabet, instead of changing all of the characters in the word. 
 
 This project has been completed. 

## Completed Goals
1) Issue where repeated series of characters are considered conflict with index number. 
2) Fixing the duplicate issue where if different letters are repeated in the inputted word, then the wrong letter is changed rather.
3) Fixing (chracters // 3 = 0) and chracters = 2 with character change in second to last letter resulting in 2 back to back conversions. 
4) Decryption Functionality
