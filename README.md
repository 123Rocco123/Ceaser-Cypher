# Ceaser Cypher
 The program will apply the Ceaser Cypher to whatever they write.

## Goals
1) Fixing the duplicate issue where if different letters are repeated in the inputted word, then the wrong letter is changed rather.
2) Fixing (chracters // 3 = 0) and chracters = 2 with character change in second to last letter resulting in 2 back to back conversions.
